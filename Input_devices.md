**What input devices would you recommend for a graphics designer:**
- Mouse & keyboard to interact with the PC and software
- Drawing pad to make drawing easier

**Input devices -** As the name suggests, input devices are hardware devices that allow data to be input into a computer

**TASK**

*Do some research and find 4 different keyboards and three different mice's. Describe what a keyboard is. Identify the differences and similarities and then compare the functionality.*

**Ergonomic keyboard -** These keyboards are designed around user support to reduce health issues.

*Similarities:*

- Most use the QWERTY layout and contain similar buttons and functions

*Differences:*

- The physical shape of the keyboard is changed, sometimes being split into two or having a bend in it.

**Gaming keyboards -** These keyboards are designed specifically for the purpose of gaming often coming with additional programmable macros / buttons.

*Similarities:*

- Uses QWERTY keyboard layout
- Has a similar shape to the average keyboard

*Differences:*

- Normally has LEDs that light up in a cool way
- Extra buttons to be programmed
- Most commonly have switches which provide a 'nicer' feel

**Common QWERTY keyboard -** These are nothing special, having the standard QWERTY layout being similar in shape and design.

**On screen keyboards -** These keyboards are used normally by people who cannot physically interact with a physical keyboard.

*Similarities:*

- Commonly use the QWERTY layout however this can be changed to fit the user's need

*Differences:*

- Instead of being a physical object they are displayed on a screen which responds to a different user input like eyeline or voice
- These are most commonly used with users who are perhaps physically uncapable of using the normal keyboard

**Mechanical mouse (ball mouse) -** It uses a rubber ball to detect motion which spins as you use the mouse.

*Similarities:*

- Still uses the same kind of technique to move the cursor as any other mouse
- Similar to a trackball mouse

*Differences:*

- As it is mechanically driven the wheels and sensors will wear out a lot quicker
- Slower then a 'average mouse'

**Optical mouse -** This is the most commonly used mouse that uses and LED to detect movement by sensing changes in the reflected light.

*Similarities:*

- Uses the a similar technique to moving the cursor as everyone else
- Wired
- Similar structure
- Uses LEDs

*Differences:*

- It doesn't work well on all surfaces, the surface must be able to reflect light properly

**Trackball mouse -** It is like an upside down mouse, instead of moving the mouse around a surface it detects motion by spinning the ball on top of the mouse.

*Similarities:*

- Similar to the mechanical mouse it can be used on any surface

*Differences:*

- You don't move the mouse around it remains stationary
- It uses the ball to move the cursor
- More commonly ergonomic and used for people who struggle to move a normal mouse

**Touchpads** are used in many laptops as a pointing device. The pointer is controlled by the finger movement.

**Uses -** Same as a mouse to move and highlight

**Advantages -** Faster to select an option, quicker navigation through applications, saves space.

**Disadvantages -** People with limited wrist movement, more difficult to control pointer.

**Touch screens -** With this the user can choose an option by simply touching the button / icon on the screen. The selection is automatically made without the need for any pointing device.

**Uses -** Used for self-service tills e.g. ATM's, supermarkets

**Advantages -** Faster entry of options than a keyboard or mouse

**Disadvantages -** There is a limited number of options available. Using them frequently can lead to RSI and muscle strain.

**Webcams** are and do not have a memory however they are connected directly to the computer. The info the webcam sees is transmitted live to the computer.

**Uses -** Allows for an increase in communication

**Advantages -** used in business

**Microphones** can be connected directly to the computer. Sounds can be inputted and then manipulated. The input sound is converted to an analogue signal and then converted to a digital signal.

**Uses -** They are used to input speech / sounds to be used in various effects.

They are used in voice recognition software which can dictate.

**Advantages -** it is faster to read in text than to type it with a keyboard.

**Disadvantages -** can sometimes require configuration and sound files can become very large

**Sensors (analog)** is a device which input and records data to a computer where the data is a measurement of some physical quantity which is always changing.

**Uses -** They are used in monitoring and control applications, depending on the situation. When monitoring, the data sent to the computer goes to a spreadsheet and processed/

**Types:** temperature, pressure, light, sound, humidity / moisture, pH

**Keyboards -** These are the most common input devices and are used to input text, numbers and instructions. Most use the QWERTY layout.

Ergonomic Keyboards are a new thing. They are designed to reduce health related issues associated with standard keyboard (Carpel Tunnel Syndrome or RSI).

**Advantages -** Keyboards enable fast entry of new text into a document

They have been around for a long time and people are well practiced in their use.

**Mouse -** The mouse is an example of a pointing device. A ball or laser light is used underneath the mouse to detect movement.

**Uses -** Mouse can be used for opening closing and minimizing

**Graphic Tablets** is a computer input tool that enables users to manually draw images and interact with the cursor using a pen like stylus.

**Advantages -** Very easy to use and interact with. Makes it easier for drawing / animation.

**Disadvantages -** It does not work for people with limited wrist movement as they may struggle to use it.
