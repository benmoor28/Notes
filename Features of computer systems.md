### Features of computer systems

#### Personal Computers (PC's)

These computer systems are typically more powerful then the average smart device, and contain hardware to perform either generalized or specific tasks (e.g. business related things, animating, editing). These computers are generally better for smaller scale businesses as they tend not to cost as much as a server. They are more expensive then the average device.

- Powerful
- Increased capabilities
- Generally used in a small business / home setting

Examples:
- Laptop
- Desktop computer

#### Mobile Devices

Any device which is inherently small in size and can be considered easily portable such as a phone or a watch is considered a mobile device. These are good for everyday use as they are very flexible in what they can do.

- They are portable
- Typically have limited performance and storage

Examples:
- Smartphones
- Tablets
- Wearables
#### Servers

Servers are a centralized computer that allows for multi-user access. They are built to store, process and manage network data, devices and systems. These are good for large-scale businesses and organizations.

- Scalable
- Efficient
- Powerful

#### Smart / internet-enabled devices

These devices are typically embedded / specialized for a specific purpose like a fridge or a watch. This makes them apart of the Internet of Things (IoT) which connects physical and digital objects. Smart devices are devices that uses technology to increase it efficiency and capability as a device.

Examples include:
- Alexa (A general home hub / assistant)
- Smart lights
- Smart fridge
- Smart watch

##### Key ideas to keep in mind when recommending a type of device

- Portability
- Power consumption
- Scalability
- Maintenance

1. **What are the the primary functions of input devices in a computer system?** To enable communication between the user and the computer. Allows users to enter data.
2. **Can you name three common input devices and describe their key characteristics?** Keyboard - allows a user to type letters and words onto the computer, Mouse - allows user to use the cursor, Microphone - allows the user to record audio
3. **What advantages do input devices offer in terms of user interaction with computers?** Input devices allows the user to configure, work and use the computer. Allows for convenience and accuracy in data entry.
4. **Are there any disadvantages associated with relying on input devices for data entry?** What if the user is unable to interact with the input devices (e.g. a disability). Then the computer cannot be used by them. Require maintenance and may lead to data entry errors.
5. **How do output devices differ from input devices in terms of their role in a computer system?** They display / output information to the user, such as video and audio; whereas input devices only receive data / information.
6. **What are the advantages of having ample RAM in a computer, and are there any limitations?** The computer will have faster loading times and increased ability to run applications. There will be excessive memory for the system to use which will increase it's overall stability.
7. **Give examples of output devices and explain the specific information they provide to users.** Monitor - displays video and allows the user to view the system and what is happening on it, Headphones / Speakers - output audio which lets the user hear videos or prompts, Printer - print a file or document that the user needs a physical copy of.
8. **What are the advantages of using output devices for data presentation and communication?** They can display information to people in a easier way to both view and understand. It makes data consumption more accessible and increases communication
9. **Are there any limitations or disadvantages of output devices in computer systems?** If the user has a disability such as being deaf or blind, they will not be able to understand the output devices. Also limitations in terms of resolution, sound quality and accuracy.
10. **What is the central role of a CPU in a computer system?** The CPU is the brains of the computer and processes all the data and instructions needed to run a system as well as operating the other components.
11. **Describe the key components of a CPU and their function.** The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) performs the mathematical and logical operations needed. The Control Unit (CU) controls them flow of data within a system and monitors communications between the hardware attached to the computer. The Cache is a storage that stores instructions closer to the CPU to decrease the time it takes to process it.
12. **What advantages does a powerful CPU offer in terms of computing capabilities?** Faster processing speed and calculations, allowing for quicker program execution and the ability to handle complex tasks effectively.
13. **Are there any disadvantages or challenges associated with high performance CPU's?** They tend to use more power. They give off more heat as well which may necessitate the cooling solutions in place.
14. **How does memory differ from storage in a computer system?** Memory is volatile meaning that when the computer turns off, none of the data will be saved and provides fast, accessible storage for active programs. This is not the case with storage as it will save the data so it will not be erased when it is switched off (non-volatile).
15. **Explain the types of memory commonly found in computers and their respective roles.** RAM - this contains all the data and processes of applications / tasks that are currently running. ROM - this contains all the data and instructions to give to the computer at startup.
